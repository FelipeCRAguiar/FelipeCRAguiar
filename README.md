ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Felipe Aguiar, Fullstack Developer student that loves everything tech. <br>
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogames and japanese culture, I love animes and manga. <br>
:computer: I decided to become a developer after finding out engeneering isn't my thing, best decision I've made so far. <br>
:checkered_flag:  My goal is to be able to connect to the world using what I learn and try to make it even a tiny bit better
